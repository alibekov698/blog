# Machine Learning with Applications (ROBT407)
## Course Description

ROBT 407 introduces the students to the state-of-the-art analytical tools and methods used for machine learning. Topics include (semi) supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, deep learning, support vector machines, the design of machine learning experiments, decision trees, linear discrimination and kernel-based learning methods. The course also contains integrated term projects. Python-based machine learning packages (e.g., scikitLearn, Pytorch, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and online databases will be used extensively.
