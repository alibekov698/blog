## Short Biography: 

Dr. Berdakh Abibullaev received his B.Sc. degree in information and communications technology from Tashkent University of Information Technologies, in 2004, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Yeungnam University, South Korea in 2006 and 2010, respectively.

He held research scientist positions at Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (2010-2013) and in the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea (2013-2014). In 2014, he received NIH (National Institute of Health, USA),a postdoctoral research fellowship, to join a multi-institutional research project between the University of Houston Brain-Machine Interface Systems Team and various clinical institutions at Texas Medical Center in developing neural interfaces for rehabilitation in post-stroke patients. He is currently an Assistant Professor at Robotics and Mechatronics Department, Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan.

Dr. Abibullaev has considerable research and clinical experience working with patient populations and physicians in applying scientific and technical skills to advance the development of treatments for neurological disorders.  

His current research focuses on designing robust neural-interfaces to control a robotic device for human augmentation, and advancing machine learning algorithms to develop new and alternative solutions to inference problems of Brain-Computer/Machine Interfaces.
