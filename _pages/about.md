## Research expertise

-   Brain-Computer/Machine Systems engineer with extensive experience in
    analyzing Brain data (EEG, ECoG, MEG, NIRS) for a real-time/offline
    mental state recognition.

-   Deep expertise in developing and applying machine learning methods
    for mining neurophysiological data both from healthy subjects as
    well as patients with Stroke and Epilepsy disorders.

-   Successfully collaborated with clinicians at medical centers in
    joint research on Stroke rehabilitation and Epilepsy surgery i.e.
    localization of epileptogenic zones from Brain data.


## Short Biography: 

Dr. Berdakh Abibullaev received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Yeungnam University, South Korea in 2006 and 2010 under the Korean Government Scholarship program. He held research scientist positions at Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology  (2010-2013) and Samsung Medical Center, South Korea (2013-2014). He was also appointed as a research professor at Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul. In 2014, he received NIH (National Institute of Health,  USA), a postdoctoral research fellowship to join a research project between the University of Houston Brain-Machine Interface Systems Team and a Texas Medical Center in developing neural interfaces for rehabilitation in post-stroke patients.  Currently, he is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Robotics and Mechatronics,  Nazarbayev University,  Kazakhstan. His research focuses on developing robust Brain-Computer/Machine Interfaces for communication and rehabilitation of people with severe motor impairments.

Dr. Abibullaev has considerable research and clinical experience working with patient populations and physicians in applying scientific and technical skills to advance the development of treatments for neurological disorders.  

His current research focuses on designing robust neural-interfaces to control a robotic device for human augmentation, and advancing machine learning algorithms to develop new and alternative solutions to inference problems of Brain-Computer/Machine Interfaces.
