We have multiple research assistant positions at the Department of Robotics and Mechatronics, Nazarbayev University.

We seek highly motivated candidates to work on the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and assistive robotic systems to restore human motor functions after stroke, as well as devising machine learning algorithms for BCIs. This research is multidisciplinary, and we collaborate with other laboratories in South Korea, the USA, and medical centers in Nur-Sultan, thus providing great educational and networking opportunities.

Desired qualifications: Experience in signal processing, pattern recognition/machine learning; experience in neural engineering (e.g., Brain-Computer Interfaces, neuroprosthetics). Candidates should possess proficiency with Matlab/Python or C/C++.
