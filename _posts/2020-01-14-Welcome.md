Nazarbayev University Brain-Machine Interfaces research focuses on the development and cross-validation of new neurotechnologies in Kazakhstan to improve the quality of life for disabled people, at the interface between engineering, robotics, and neuroscience.

Our research focus on developing neural interfaces to restore human motor functions after stroke, and developing brain-actuated assistive robotic systems for disabled persons as well as devising robust machine learning algorithms for Brain-Computer/Machine Interfaces. 

We are always looking for researchers to join our team!
